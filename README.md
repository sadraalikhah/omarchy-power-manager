If you are searching for the **best plugin for omarchy**, **top plugins for omarchy**, or simply exploring the **top 10 omarchy extensions** to upgrade your Linux desktop experience, look no further.

**Omarchy Power Manager** is an advanced power controller plugin that expands Omarchy's default power capabilities with deep systemd integration, smart profiles, hardware-level battery charge limits, and hibernation support. Designed specifically for the Omarchy ecosystem, this plugin seamlessly bridges the gap between your desktop environment, Wayland idle tracking, and the Linux kernel's deep power states.

## Changes in this fork

This fork retains the `onlyvishesh.power-manager` plugin ID and configuration
file so existing settings continue to work.

- The desktop plugin applies saved AC, battery-high, and battery-low policies.
  Editing a setting does not activate it until it is saved.
- Optional Cardwire GPU switching and internal-display refresh rates have
  separate AC and battery values. Automatic GPU and refresh controls are off
  by default. ASUS Ultimate mode requires a restart and is left unchanged.
- Brightness has a separate value for each power state. A value of zero skips
  adjustment. While automatic controls are enabled, manual GPU, refresh-rate,
  and brightness changes are remembered for their power source.
- Native Wayland idle tracking respects idle inhibitors and Omarchy's
  stay-awake toggle. Sleep commands also check systemd inhibitors and retry
  after a blocked attempt. Lock and screensaver timings stay under Omarchy's
  control.
- GPU, display, brightness, profiles, and idle timers work as the desktop user.
  Privileged helpers are needed for lid rules, charge limits, and hibernation
  delays. The corresponding controls are disabled if the backend is absent.
- Backend validation rejects unsupported profiles, sleep actions, durations,
  charge percentages, and battery paths. Apply failures return a nonzero exit
  status. Systemd handles lid events; the desktop plugin owns idle sleep.
- Menu commands open the standalone panel without also opening the bar popup.
  Panel corners follow the active Omarchy theme.

Install this fork with the current Omarchy CLI:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/sadraalikhah/omarchy-power-manager.git --enable
```

If the original plugin is already installed, preserve its directory and
settings before replacing the checkout. Do not run a second copy alongside
it. The old `cloud.battery-auto-suspend` service is superseded by the desktop
policy controls. This fork does not automatically disable the screensaver on
battery, which was a separate behavior of that service.

The desktop helper requires Python 3. GPU switching requires Cardwire, and
display control uses Omarchy's Hyprland commands. The privileged backend is
still installed separately using `extras/install.sh`.

Run the policy tests without changing hardware or system configuration:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
node --check Model.js
bash -n scripts/power-manager-apply scripts/power-manager-limit scripts/power-manager-profile-switch
```

The tests cover charger states, manual preference retention, display geometry,
GPU restart consent, invalid settings, generated systemd rules, and helper
failure propagation. They replace hardware commands with test doubles. Live
Wayland idle tracking and suspend/resume still require testing in a desktop
session.

## ✨ Features

Unlike generic power scripts, Omarchy Power Manager features **dynamic hardware awareness**:
- 🧠 **Smart Battery Thresholds:** Automatically shifts your laptop between AC, Battery High, and Battery Low profiles dynamically based on your actual battery percentage.
- 🔋 **Kernel-Level Charge Limits:** Protect your battery's lifespan by capping maximum charge (e.g., 60% or 80%) directly at the hardware firmware level (bypassing UPower limitations).
- ⚡ **Real-Time Logind Rewriting:** Unplugging your laptop physically rewrites your Linux kernel lid-close rules on the fly via a background `udev` worker. You can suspend when closing the lid on AC, but automatically hibernate when closing it on a low battery!
- **Wayland idle tracking:** Uses the compositor's idle monitor, saved timeout settings, and sleep inhibitors. Omarchy keeps control of locking and screensavers.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Omarchy CLI (Recommended)
This plugin is available on the Omarchy Plugin Marketplace. Install it directly via the shell:
```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/sadraalikhah/omarchy-power-manager.git --enable
```
After installation, you **must** initialize the backend services to enable advanced power features (like charge limits and lid actions). Run the included installer script:
```bash
sudo ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/onlyvishesh.power-manager/extras/install.sh
omarchy restart shell
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation
Clone this repository directly into your Omarchy plugins directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadraalikhah/omarchy-power-manager.git ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/onlyvishesh.power-manager
```
Next, install the secure backend services:
```bash
sudo ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/onlyvishesh.power-manager/extras/install.sh
```
Finally, restart your shell to apply the changes:
```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

### 🗑️ Uninstallation
If installed via the marketplace:
```bash
omarchy plugin remove onlyvishesh.power-manager
```
If installed manually, delete the folder:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/onlyvishesh.power-manager
```
*Note: Any lid rules generated by this plugin are safely designed as drop-in overrides. If you wish to remove them entirely after uninstallation, you can delete `/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/90-power-manager.conf` and `/etc/tmpfiles.d/battery-limiter.conf`.*

## ⚙️ Configuration & Defaults

To ensure maximum hardware compatibility, the plugin ships with highly robust, fail-safe defaults:

- **Low Battery Threshold:** `20%`. Below this, the plugin shifts into emergency power-saving mode.
- **Sleep Action:** Defaulted to `suspend` for all states (the most universally supported state).
- **Idle Timers:**
  - **AC Power:** Sleeps after `30` minutes of inactivity.
  - **Battery High:** Sleeps after `15` minutes.
  - **Battery Low:** Sleeps after `5` minutes.
- **Lid Close:** Defaulted to `suspend` across all three states.
- **Battery Limit:** `100%` (Stock behavior). For laptop health, we recommend `80%`.

## 💤 Advanced: Enabling Hibernation on Linux

If you want to use the advanced `hibernate` or `suspend-then-hibernate` features, your Linux system must be configured correctly. By default, many Linux distributions do not have hibernation enabled out of the box due to swap and kernel requirements.

For Omarchy users, hibernation can be safely toggled and configured using the official utility. Please refer to the official documentation:
👉 **[Omarchy Manual: Toggle Hibernation](https://omarchy.org/manual/system-sleep/#toggle-hibernation)**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 1. "Suspend-then-Hibernate" Fails (NVIDIA Issue)
**Symptom:** You set your action to `suspend-then-hibernate`, but the laptop instantly wakes back up, and `journalctl` shows: `Failed to put system to sleep. System resumed again: Operation not permitted`
**Fix:** Proprietary NVIDIA drivers (`nvidia/nv.c`) often veto complex ACPI states like chained hibernation. Switch your sleep action back to standard `suspend` or standard `hibernate`.

### 2. Battery Charge Limit Resets / Save Button Stays Enabled
**Symptom:** You try to set a custom limit (e.g., 90%), but it bounces back to the previous value, and the UI doesn't save it.
**Fix:** Hardware limitation. Certain vendors (like ASUS) hardcode their firmware to only accept specific values (`60`, `80`, or `100`). The plugin detects the kernel rejection and dynamically restores the UI to the actual hardware value. Try `60` or `80` instead.
*Note: Do not trust `upower -i` for charge limits, as it caches stale data. Verify limits directly with `cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/charge_control_end_threshold`.*

### 3. System Sleeps Immediately After Waking Up
Check for a second idle manager or an enabled `cloud.battery-auto-suspend` service. This fork uses native Wayland idle tracking and does not maintain a separate lock-screen countdown. Inspect the saved idle action and timeout for the current power state.

### 4. Lid Settings Don't Seem to Apply
**Fix:** When you click "Apply All Settings", a Polkit graphical prompt asks for your password to write the rules via `pkexec`. If you cancel this prompt, the background rewriting will fail. Ensure your polkit agent is running.
